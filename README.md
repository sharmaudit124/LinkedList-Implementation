# Singly-LinkedList-Implementation ✔
Here is a Java implementation of a <strong>Singly linked list</strong>. So you can see how the real functions of a linked list work.<br>
 <h3>Below are the following functions:👀</h3><hr>
  🧵 To insert a value at last. <br>
  🧵 To insert a value at some given index. <br>
  🧵 To traverse in Linked List. <br>
  🧵 To get size of singly linked list. <br>
  🧵 To delete last Node. <br>
  🧵 To delete any node at a given index. <br>
  🧵 To find center of a Linked list. <br>
  🧵 To get a whole node of a particular index. <br>
  🧵 To check the presence of an element in Linked List. <br>
