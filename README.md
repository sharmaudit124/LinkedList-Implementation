# Singly-LinkedList-Implementation âœ”
Here is a Java implementation of a Singly linked list. So you can see how the real functions of a linked list work.
ğŸ‘€ Below are the following functions:
  ğŸ§µ To insert a value at last
  ğŸ§µ To insert a value at some given index
  ğŸ§µ To traverse in Linked List
  ğŸ§µ To get size of singly linked list
  ğŸ§µ To delete last Node
  ğŸ§µ To delete any node at a given index
  ğŸ§µ To find center of a Linked list
  ğŸ§µ To get a whole node of a particular index
  ğŸ§µ To check the presence of an element in Linked List
